# Zn-Rotations-Cryptosystem

An implementation of the [BGPS cryptosystem](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1548.pdf), based on rotations of the $\mathbb{Z}^n$ lattice.

## Building and running 

The following dependencies are required:
- [fplll](https://github.com/fplll/fplll) 
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
- [CryptoTools](https://github.com/ladnir/cryptoTools)
- [MPFR](https://www.mpfr.org/)

When cloning the repo, make sure you clone the submodule as well, which can be done with the `--recursive` flag:

`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ryanjlittle/Zn-Rotations-Cryptosystem`

The project can be built using cmake:

`$ cmake . && cmake --build . --target ZnRotationCryptosystem`

Documentation is autogenerated by Doxygen and available in the docs folder.

## Challenges
Challenge public keys and ciphertexts are given in the `challenges` folder. Each challenge subfolder corresponds to a fixed $n$ value and decryption failure probability $p_f$ value. For example, the subfolder `n128_fp2-10` contains challenges for $n=128$ with $p_f=2^{-10}$.
